## Frequently Asked Questions

### "Why would I use Tyler over free options?"

**Answer**: Developer time isn't free. If it takes you 40 hours to write docs manually in Docusaurus, that's $4,000 at $100/hour. Tyler generates comprehensive docs in 45 minutes for $8.

---

### "Why not use Mintlify if I can afford it?"

**Answer**:
1. **Cost**: $7,200 over 5 years vs. $75 for Tyler
2. **Vendor lock-in**: Mintlify hosts your docs, Tyler gives you Markdown files
3. **Quality**: Tyler's deep AI understanding produces better architecture docs

Mintlify makes sense if you need hosted solution and have budget, but Tyler is better for most use cases.

---

### "Can Tyler compete with manually-written docs?"

**Answer**: Tyler-generated docs are typically:
- **Better than**: Most manually-written API docs (more consistent, complete)
- **Comparable to**: Good manually-written comprehensive docs
- **Not as good as**: Exceptional, hand-crafted docs by technical writers

For 95% of projects, Tyler's quality is more than sufficient.

---

### "What if I need continuous updates?"

**Answer**: Tyler is best for:
- Initial documentation generation
- Periodic updates (monthly or quarterly)
- Major version releases

For **real-time updates** (docs change hourly), Mintlify's auto-sync is better. But realistically, most projects don't need hourly doc updates.

---

### "Is Tyler suitable for enterprise?"

**Answer**: Yes, with considerations:
- ✅ Cost-effective for multiple projects
- ✅ Full control over documentation
- ✅ Can run on internal infrastructure
- ⚠️ No built-in analytics (use Google Analytics)
- ⚠️ No multi-version UI (manual setup)
- ⚠️ No hosted solution (must self-host)

For enterprises that want to save money and own their docs, Tyler is excellent. For enterprises that need white-glove service, Mintlify Enterprise is better.

---
